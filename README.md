## Hacker News - Web Scraper

A  CLI web scraper built with Node.js that retrieves top stories from Y Combinators Hacker News. Given the value n as input from the user, the program will return between 1 and 100 stories.

## Motivation

I decided to use this challenge as a learning opportunity having never worked with Node.js before or it's frameworks.
